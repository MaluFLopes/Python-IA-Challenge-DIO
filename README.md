# Python-IA-Challenge-DIO

[github.com/digitalinnovationone/santander-dev-week-2023-api]: GitHub with the API developed for Santander Dev Week 2023 with useful information (including the Swagger link and important data on the availability of the API). Relevant for those who want to know more about the process of creating the RESTful API I consumed in this Lab.
